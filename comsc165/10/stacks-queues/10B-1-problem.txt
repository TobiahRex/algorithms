Create a Dynamic Stack to store strings.

•Design a class that stores strings on
a dynamic stack. The strings should not be fixed in length.
The class should have a structure for the stack nodes, constructor,
destructor and stack operation functions to:
add a value to the stack;
remove a value from the stack;
check if the stack is empty.

•Write a program to create a dynamic stack object. Push the strings
"one", "two", and "three" onto the stack. Pop the three strings from
the stack and display them. Call the pop function again to see what
your program displays when you pop an empty stack.
